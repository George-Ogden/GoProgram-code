<h2>Donate</h2>
<p>The website costs money to run, as do all the open source projects that I work on and the weekly videos that I publish. These rely on an entirely donation-based system. Please, consider <a href="/patreon" target="blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Donate">donating via Patreon</a> to support the site as well as receiving exclusive benefits and early access.</p>
