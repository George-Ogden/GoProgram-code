<h2>Redesign</h2>
<p>The site has been redesigned to transform the look. After taking a visual design course, I applied what I learnt to create a clean, more modern look. Have a look at <a href="https:old.goprogram.co.uk">the old site</a> to see the miraculous transformation.</p>

<h2>UNIX Commands</h2>
<p>If you use a command line interface, the best choice is undoubtedly Linux, as the commands in Windows are fairly limited. However, it is possible to <a href=/software/commands>download the Coreutils (as well as other commands), which have already been compiled for Windows</a> to increase the diversity and range of commands that can be used on Windows devices and make the command line seem more like a Linux machine.</p></div></section><?php include "../footer.php" ?><?php include "../scripts.php" ?></html>
